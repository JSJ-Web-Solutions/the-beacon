          Hey Settlers! We're thrilled to announce that we've successfully met
          all of our Q3 goals, and as we bid farewell to this quarter, we want
          to take a moment to reflect on what we've accomplished and what's
          coming up next.

              sustainable long-term, thanks to Tinkererâ„¢, our new custom
              schematics system, we can create all gameplay-related logic in a
              much easier, faster, and streamlined manner. This might also allow
              us to implement UGC tools in the future.
